## E-Commerce Management System – Final Project in C#

This project implements a **complete e-commerce simulation** developed in **C#**, showcasing the evolution from console-based object-oriented design to a **graphical user interface (GUI)** using Visual Studio.

### 🛒 System Overview
The system manages an online marketplace containing:
- **Buyers** and **Sellers**
- **Products** organized by categories (Kids, Electronics, Office, Clothing)
- **Shopping carts**, **orders**, and **purchase history**

Users can:
- Add new buyers and sellers  
- Add products to sellers and buyers’ carts  
- Perform checkout and view order history  
- Save and load data from files  
- Interact via a user-friendly GUI with buttons and menus  

### 🔹 Technical Highlights
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Classes for users, products, and orders with inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.  
- **Collections & Generics:** Transitioned from arrays to `List<T>` collections for flexible data management.  
- **Exception Handling:** Input validation and custom exceptions (e.g., preventing single-item orders).  
- **Operator Overloading:** Implemented `+` to add buyers/sellers and `<` to compare shopping cart totals.  
- **File I/O:** Persisted sellers and products between sessions.  
- **GUI Development:** Implemented the first graphical interface using Windows Forms in Visual Studio.

### 💡 Key Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of OOP principles in C#  
- Error handling and operator overloading  
- Managing data persistence and collections  
- Designing an intuitive user interface
